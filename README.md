# Bao Bao's Python Practice Plan

Goals:

1. Recall the Python Basis that Bao has learned. (And also some basic console, git manipulation)
2. Get famalier with the Markdown (and some LaTeX syntax for formula) and be able to take note with it.
3. Practice keyboard typing and English when taking notes or coding.

> Also understand some basic knowledge like what is relative path and so on.

## Getting Started

First few steps to get started.

1. Open the terminal (`⌘ + space` and search for iTerm)
2. Go to the directory (folder) you want to place this project by using `cd` or maybe `ls` to see the content
3. Clone (download) this repository using `git clone https://github.com/baobaocoding/PythonBasis.git`
4. Go to this project directory `cd PythonBasis`
5. Open this directory as workspace using VSCode by typing `code .` (The `.` means current directory)

How to submit my changes?

1. Add the changes by either inside the VSCode's Source Control View or using `git add -A` to add all the changes you've made
2. Commit the changes by either inside the VSCode's Source Control View or using `git commit -m "the description of current changes"`
3. Submit/Upload/Synchronize the changes to GitHub by the left-bottom button in VSCode or using `git push`

How to get the latest update from Github?

1. Use the left-bottom button in VSCode or using `git fetch` and then `git pull` (make sure the current repository (directory) is clean (no unstage modification))

## Schedule

Recall the Python Basis

| Subject                                          | Start Date | Finished (Y/N) |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| [Variable and Basic Calculation](Python/VarCalc) | 2019/6/25  | Y (2019/6/27)  |
| [If Condition](Python/IfCondition)               | 2019/6/27  | Y (2019/8/22)  |
| [Loops](Python/Loop)                             | 2019/8/22  | N              |
| [Function and Module](FunctionModule)            | 2019/8/23  | N              |

## Note

> You can oragnize your notes here. First create a link to a file by Markdown link syntax `[link name](link to file or website)` to your file. And press `⌘` click left mouse button it will ask if to create the file. (If the file exist then it will jump to the file immediately.)
